## Why Use ggplot2 in R?

The first step to any data analysis project should be to explore your data.  The easiest and fastest way to do this is through graphics.  Although you can create plots in many programs including base R, the ggplot2 package is fairly quick to learn and makes life easier in at least ten ways (see Many Mejia’s post with examples)

* Flexibility: It can do quick-and-dirty AND complex plots, so you only need one system
* Handsome default settings: the default colors & other aesthetics are nice…much better than Excel
* You don’t have to think hard: no need to specify outer or inner margins among other things
* You can save your plots (or the beginnings of a plot) as an object
* Multivariate exploration is greatly simplified through faceting and coloring
* Easily build plots in layers to tell a more complete story
* Let your plots evolve (or devolve) with minimal changes to code
* Make layered histograms and other cool plots
* It’s not that hard and takes very little code
* The documentation and support is great
